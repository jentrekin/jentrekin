### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hello, I'm [Jessica Entrekin](https://www.kaylajamesllc.com)!

I work as a continuous learner of all front-end items. I´m based in California.

Since 2019 I've been working towards a more exciting and challenging life that brings my creativity and detail-orientated skill set together. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design & code. ✨😍
